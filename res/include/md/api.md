# API documentation

Methods for using pixeldrain programmatically.

## Authentication

All methods which create, modify or delete a resource require an API key. API
keys can be obtained from your user account's [API keys page](/user/api_keys).

To use the API key you need to enter it in the password field of [HTTP Basic
Access
Authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). The
username field does not matter, it can be empty or anything else.

Example usage in JavaScript:

```js
const resp = await fetch(
	"https://pixeldrain.com/api/user/files",
	headers: {
		"Authorization": "Basic "+btoa(":"+api_key),
		// The btoa function encodes the key to Base64
	},
)
if(resp.status >= 400) {
	throw new Error(await resp.json())
}
result = await resp.json()
```

Some JSON responses include fields which end in "_href" (some people don't know
this, but "href" stands for "Hypertext Reference", the more you know). These
point to different places in the API, which you can retrieve with a GET request.
The path is to be appended to the API URL, so "/file/someid/thumbnail" becomes
"{{apiUrl}}/file/someid/thumbnail".

The base URL for the API is "{{apiUrl}}", all paths below are relative to that
URL.

## curl example

To upload files to pixeldrain you will need an API key. Get an API key from the
[API keys page](/user/api_keys) and enter it in the command. Replace the example
API key here with your own:

`curl -T "file_name.txt" -u :5f45f184-64bb-4eaa-be19-4a5f0459db49
https://pixeldrain.com/api/file/`

## Response format

Every API endpoint which does not return raw file data responds with JSON. A
JSON response always contains a `success` field. When a request fails (the HTTP
status code is 400 or higher) the response also contains a `value` field with a
machine-readable error code and a `message` field with a human-readable
explanation of what went wrong:

```
HTTP 404: Not Found
{
	"success": false,
	"value": "not_found",
	"message": "The entity you requested could not be found"
}
```

The `message` text can change between versions of the API, the `value` code is
stable. Use `value` when handling errors programmatically.

Some errors contain an `extra` object with additional information about the
error, like which form field caused it:

```
HTTP 400: Bad Request
{
	"success": false,
	"value": "missing_field",
	"message": "A required field was not sent with this request. See extra for more information",
	"extra": {
		"field": "name"
	}
}
```

### Multiple errors

Endpoints which validate multiple form fields can return more than one error in
a single response. In that case the `value` is multiple_errors and the
response contains an `errors` array. Each element of the array is a normal
error object as described above:

```
HTTP 400: Bad Request
{
	"success": false,
	"value": "multiple_errors",
	"message": "This API endpoint can return multiple errors which need to be checked individually. See the errors array",
	"errors": [
		{
			"success": false,
			"value": "string_out_of_range",
			"message": "A string parameter you passed was either too short or too long",
			"extra": {
				"field": "name",
				"min_len": 1,
				"max_len": 255,
				"len": 300
			}
		},
		{
			"success": false,
			"value": "missing_field",
			"message": "A required field was not sent with this request. See extra for more information",
			"extra": {
				"field": "file"
			}
		}
	]
}
```

The HTTP status of a multiple_errors response is 400, unless one of the
contained errors is a server error, then it's elevated to 500.

## Error codes

These error codes can be returned by any API endpoint. Errors which only apply
to a specific endpoint are documented with that endpoint.

### General errors

Value                       | HTTP status | Description
----------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------

### Input validation errors

These errors are returned when a request contains invalid input. Where possible
the `extra` object contains a `field` key with the name of the offending form
field.
